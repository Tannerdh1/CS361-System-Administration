#Task 1
sudo groupadd -g 4001 dave
sudo useradd -u 4001 -g 4001 -md /home/pink/dave dave
sudo groupadd -g 4002 roger
sudo useradd -u 4002 -g 4002 -md /home/pink/roger roger
sudo groupadd- g 4003 nick
sudo useradd -u 4003 -g 4003 -md /home/pink/nick nick
sudo groupadd -g 4004 richard
sudo useradd -u 4004 -g 4004 -md /home/pink/richard richard
sudo passwd dave, password is banana23 so I have to enter it in twice to confirm.
sudo passwd roger, password is apple59
sudo passwd nick, password is orange90
sudo passwd richard, password is lemon37
Used cat /etc/passwd to check if they were there and then I logged into them.

#Task 2
sudo groupadd -g 10000 guitars
sudo usermod -G 10000 dave
sudo usermod -G 10000 roger
I used less /etc/group to find guitars and then I logged into dave and roger and checked their groups with the command groups.

#Task 3
Alt f5 to get to new terminal and logged in as dave
mkdir collaborative
chgrp guitars collaborative
sudo chgrp g+s collaborative
I then used ls -l to check the group owner of collaborative and I did sudo chgrp g+S collaborative as the administrator to make all
new files created in the directory have their group as the directory's group which is guitars. I did umask to allow group permissions for the new files created. I then made two separate files under dave and roger and edited as the respective user. I then editied dave's file as roger and roger's file as dave.

#Task 4
Run the command umask, gets 0002
default permissions for files is; -rw-rw-r--
default permissions for directories is; rwxrwxr-x
Default permissions for files is 666 minus the umask. 664
Default permissions for directories is 777 minus the umask. 775

#Task 5
the permissions wanted for files is rw--w-r--, 624
the permissions wanted for directories is rwx-wxr--, 734
777-734=043
I set umsk to 043 and created a file and directory to check the permissions and they were correct. So I logged out and added to umask 043 to .bashrc at the top. I logged out and logged back in.
I created a new file and a new directory and checked their permissions and they were the default wanted.

#Task 6
Added umask 0173 to /etc/profile at the top as the administartor. I then logged into several of the accounts and tested it. Richard is still the one set for Task 5 instead of the system default.

#Task 7
sudo usermod -m -d /home/chaos/roger/ roger
I checked the creation of chaos and roger by doing ls /home/chaos. I then logged into roger and had access.

#Task 8
sudo usermod -u 5001 dave
sudo chgrp g+s collaborative
After I changed the uID I logged into dave and checked his files and directories and everything was still fine.

#Task 9
sudo groupmod -g 20000 guitars
I did cat /etc/group and found guitars. Along with dave and roger following the name and id.
